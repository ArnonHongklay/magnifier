### missing features
- see [roadmap](https://github.com/jipiboily/bloggy/wiki/Roadmap)!


## Installation
### 1. Add the gem to your `Gemfile`.
```ruby
gem 'bloggy'
```
And run `bundle install` to fetch the gem and update your 'Gemfile.lock'.

### 2. Route to Bloggy

Add this to your route file (`config/routes.rb`)
```ruby
# This line mounts Bloggy's routes at the root of your application.
# This means, any requests to URLs such as /my-post, will go to Bloggy::PostsController.
# If you would like to change where this engine is mounted, simply change the :at option to something different.
#
# We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Bloggy relies on it being the default of "bloggy"
mount Bloggy::Engine, at: '/' # or whatever path, be it "/blog" or "/bloggy"
```
For example, if you decide to mount it at  `/blog`, the admin section will be available at `/blog/bloggy`.
Here we decide to use bloggy as default route mounting it at `/`, it means that the admin section will directly
be available at `/bloggy`.

### 3. Migrate Bloggy's database tables
Run these commands:

1. $`bin/rake bloggy:install:migrations`
2. $`bin/rake db:create` (only if this is a new project)
3. $`bin/rake db:migrate`


### 4. Create a user
Open your development console with `bin/rails c`, then:
```ruby
Bloggy::User.create(name: "bloggy", email:"bloggy@example.com", password:"my-password", password_confirmation: "my-password")
```

### 5. Configure Bloggy.
This is all done in an initializer file, typically `config/initializers/bloggy.rb`. More on this in the [Wiki - Configuration](https://github.com/jipiboily/bloggy/wiki/Configuration).

### 6. Ready
Start your server and go to [http://localhost:3000/bloggy](http://localhost:3000/bloggy) to log in the admin section.


### Note to users
Bloggy is using its own tables. If you want to use your own tables with bloggy (for example the User table)
this might help you to [monkey patch](https://gist.github.com/jipiboily/776d907fc932640ac59a).

## Customization
See the [Wiki - Customizations](https://github.com/jipiboily/bloggy/wiki/Customizations).

## Copy views
copy views like devise `rails g bloggy:views`
or use scope: `rails g bloggy:views blog`

## Requirements
- Rails 4.2.1 +
- Database: MySQL & Postgres are supported but other databases might work too.
